# Subtitle Translation Guide

## Philosophy

Subtitles are for WATCHING a movie, not reading a book. The translation should be invisible: if the viewer notices they're reading subtitles, you failed.

## Principles

### 1. Naturalness over literalness

Translate the MEANING, not the words. If someone says "It's raining cats and dogs", don't write "Están lloviendo gatos y perros".

A good translation sounds like the character actually speaks that language.

### 2. One block = one idea

```
15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I think we should go
to the store tomorrow.
```

This is ONE sentence: "Creo que deberíamos ir a la tienda mañana." Read both lines together before translating.

### 3. Freedom in form

If the original uses 2 lines but your translation fits in 1: perfect.
If you need 2 lines when the original had 1: also perfect.

What matters is that it fits in the time and reads well.

### 4. Context is everything

Read the entire chunk before translating. Block 47 might change how you translate block 12.

"He's gone" can be:
- "Se fue" (left the room)
- "Murió" (sad context)
- "Está perdido" (can't find him)

### 5. Respect the register

If the character speaks vulgar, translate vulgar.
If they speak formal, translate formal.
If they speak like a child, translate like a child.

Don't "clean up" the dialogue or make it more elegant than it is.

### 6. Conciseness

The viewer has ~2-3 seconds to read. If your translation is longer than the original, find shorter synonyms or rephrase.

"At this precise moment" → "Now"
"With the objective of" → "To"

### 7. Names

- People: DON'T translate (Michael ≠ Miguel)
- Famous places: use judgment (New York → New York, but London → Londres if common in target language)
- Titles: DO translate (Mr. → Sr.)

### 8. Shared context

You read and write to `context.md`. Use it wisely:

**CHECK** before translating:
- If there's an established term, use it (consistency)
- If there are notes about a character, respect them

**ADD** only if useful for future chunks:
- Invented/fictional term that will repeat
- Character with particular way of speaking
- Relevant narrative context

**DON'T add:**
- Obvious translations
- Information that doesn't affect translation
- Everything that comes to mind (moderation)
